Question: "What is the main subject?"
Answer: "Main subjects identified: himƒÅlaya (Himalaya, the divine mountain), 
         devatƒÅtmƒÅ (divine-souled entity)"
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from demo_intensive_qa import IntensivelyTrainedQADemo

demo = IntensivelyTrainedQADemo("best_kumarasambhava_model.pth")
answer = demo.generate_contextual_answer(context, question)
```
